# Weather Application

A simple weather application that displays the current temperature and visualizes it with a graph. 
I made the application to use it instead of the default weather app, but this is not the intended effect yet. 
With plans for future completion.

## Features

- Fetches the user's location and retrieves weather data.
- Displays the temperature in Fahrenheit in main circle and Celsius on a graph.
- Interactive graph showing temperature trends in Celsius, with tooltips displaying exact values on hover "column space".

## Installation

soon
